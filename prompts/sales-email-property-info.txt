Generate the body of the email, which will have the next format:


<h1>[Should be a title in bold that includes the name of the property: {!$Input:Property__c.Name}]</h1>
<p>[Should be a paragraph explaining the characteristics of the house, such as, {!$Input:Property__c.Baths__c}, {!$Input:Property__c.Beds__c}.]</p>
<img src="{!$Input:Property__c.Picture__c}" alt="{!$Input:Property__c.Name}"/>
<p>[Should include a comparison with the other properties for which the prospect demonstrated interest, only if there are some. This is what I found: {!$Apex:ContactPropertyInterestService.Prompt}]</p>
<p>[Should include a paragraph proposing a visit to the house with your prospect, and express a desire to learn more about their needs.]</p>
<p>[End the email including here a clear call to action for the prospect to respond and schedule a visit.]</p>


Add CSS styles to the img tag so the picture is centered, and to the paragraphs so they look nice.
