## Installing Dreamhouse using a Scratch Org

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/) Trailhead project. The steps include:

    - Enable Dev Hub in your Trailhead Playground
    - Install Salesforce CLI
    - Install Visual Studio Code
    - Install the Visual Studio Code Salesforce extensions, including the Lightning Web Components extension

1. If you haven't already done so, authorize your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

    ```
    sf org login web -d -a myhuborg
    ```

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/trailheadapps/dreamhouse-lwc
    cd dreamhouse-lwc
    ```

1. Create a scratch org and provide it with an alias (**dreamhouse** in the command below):

    ```
    sf org create scratch -d -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a dreamhouse
    ```

1. Push the app to your scratch org:

    ```
    sf project deploy start
    ```

1. Assign the **dreamhouse** permission set to the default user:

    ```
    sf org assign permset -n dreamhouse
    ```

1. (Optional) Assign the `Walkthroughs` permission set to the default user.

    > Note: this will enable your user to use In-App Guidance Walkthroughs, allowing you to be taken through a guided tour of the sample app. The Walkthroughs permission set gets auto-created with In-App guidance activation.

    ```
    sf org assign permset -n Walkthroughs
    ```

1. Import sample data:

    ```
    sf data tree import -p data/sample-data-plan.json
    ```

1. Open the scratch org:

    ```
    sf org open
    ```

1. In **Setup**, under **Themes and Branding**, activate the **Lightning Lite** theme.

1. In App Launcher, select the **Dreamhouse** app.

## Installing Dreamhouse using an Unlocked Package

Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the app to a more permanent environment than a Scratch org or if you don't want to install the local developement tools. You can use a non source-tracked orgs such as a free [Developer Edition Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or a [Trailhead Playground](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/).

Make sure to start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with previous work you may have done.

1. Log in to your org

1. Click [this link](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tKY000000LgZyYAK) to install the Dreamhouse unlocked package in your org.

1. Select **Install for All Users**

1. In App Launcher, click **View all**, select the Dreamhouse app.

1. Click the **Settings** tab and click the **Import Data** button in the **Sample Data Import** component.

1. If you're attempting the [Quick Start](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/quick-start-dreamhouse-sample-app) on Trailhead, this step is required, but otherwise, skip:

    - Go to **Setup > Users > Permission Sets**.
    - Click **dreamhouse**.
    - Click **Manage Assignments**.
    - Check your user and click **Add Assignments**.

1. In **Setup**, under **Themes and Branding**, activate the **Lightning Lite** theme.

1. In App Launcher, select the **Dreamhouse** app.

## Installing Dreamhouse using a Developer Edition Org or a Trailhead Playground

Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the app to a more permanent environment than a Scratch org.
This includes non source-tracked orgs such as a [free Developer Edition Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or a [Trailhead Playground](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/).

Make sure to start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with previous work you may have done.

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/trailheadapps/dreamhouse-lwc
    cd dreamhouse-lwc
    ```

1. Authorize your Trailhead Playground or Developer org and provide it with an alias (**mydevorg** in the command below):

    ```
    sf org login web -s -a mydevorg
    ```

1. Run this command in a terminal to deploy the app.

    ```
    sf project deploy start -d force-app
    ```

1. Assign the `dreamhouse` permission set to the default user.

    ```
    sf org assign permset -n dreamhouse
    ```

1. Import some sample data.

    ```
    sf data tree import -p ./data/sample-data-plan.json
    ```

1. If your org isn't already open, open it now:

    ```
    sf org open -o mydevorg
    ```

1. In **Setup**, under **Themes and Branding**, activate the **Lightning Lite** theme.

1. In App Launcher, select the **Dreamhouse** app.

## Note on Sample Data Import

Properties inserted using the Salesforce CLI will appear as listed on TODAY() - 10 days. If you want to have this value randomized, perform the data import from the app Settings tab instead.

## Optional Installation Instructions

This repository contains several files that are relevant if you want to integrate modern web development tooling to your Salesforce development processes, or to your continuous integration/continuous deployment processes.

### Code formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io 'https://prettier.io/') is a code formatter used to ensure consistent formatting across your code base. To use Prettier with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.prettierignore](/.prettierignore) and [.prettierrc](/.prettierrc) files are provided as part of this repository to control the behavior of the Prettier formatter.

> **Warning**
> The current Apex Prettier plugin version requires that you install Java 11 or above.

### Code linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a popular JavaScript linting tool used to identify stylistic errors and erroneous constructs. To use ESLint with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-lwc) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.eslintignore](/.eslintignore) file is provided as part of this repository to exclude specific files from the linting process in the context of Lightning Web Components development.

### Pre-commit hook

This repository also comes with a [package.json](./package.json) file that makes it easy to set up a pre-commit hook that enforces code formatting and linting by running Prettier and ESLint every time you `git commit` changes.

To set up the formatting and linting pre-commit hook:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you haven't already done so
1. Run `npm install` in your project's root folder to install the ESLint and Prettier modules (Note: Mac users should verify that Xcode command line tools are installed before running this command.)

Prettier and ESLint will now run automatically every time you commit changes. The commit will fail if linting errors are detected. You can also run the formatting and linting from the command line using the following commands (check out [package.json](./package.json) for the full list):

```
npm run lint
npm run prettier
```

## Code Tours

Code Tours are guided walkthroughs that will help you understand the app code better. To be able to run them, install the [CodeTour VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour).
